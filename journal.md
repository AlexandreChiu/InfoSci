What did we do?
We created variations to the circles we created using code , such as adding lines to the circles, changing the color, size, and rate in which the cirlces appear. In the end, we tried to make a dice using our knowledge on how to create circles and squares. 
What did we learn?
We learned how to write simple code and created a bunch of circles using this new knowledge. We learned how to add color, how to randomize factors and variables
What questions do I have?
I want to know how to create and work with other shapes, as well as how to draw with these shapes.
